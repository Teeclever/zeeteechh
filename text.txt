Zeetech computers and green energy 
Formerly known as Zeetech college of computer is a computer school founded on April 3,2011.
Which started operation in OKo-Afo bustop in Badagry, Lagos State Nigeria.
It was a very small accommodation not until we got a bigger place not to far from the old location in the street of Oloruntobi opposite Oko-afo secondary school.
Our new location was able to accommodate up to a 100 students at once,
Making it possible for us to accommodate various departments such as: Desktop publishing department in which we have data processing and secretariat studies, Engineering department, Website design department and as well as the Computer Engineering department.
We have so far been doing well. 
Our director Mr Azeez Olatunji Olaiya is the founder of this great institute. He had his NCE in Adeniran Ogunsaya College of Education and also proceeded with a degree course in Lagos State University, And another degree course in tentia university, which is a private university. He has undergone training and studies and has travelled far and wide in order to acquire advance experience and knowledge that would help shed more light  and inculcate more knowledge regarding all that it takes in computers and technology
into people.
we have excelled and would continue to excel in all areas. We are considered as the second best computer school in Badagry and so far since the inception from 2011 to 2022, we have successfully trained 1470 students, who have been trained in one aspect of computer or the other and hence been granted certificates. 
Zeetech Computers and Green Energy is a place u should be.
